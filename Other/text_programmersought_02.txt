Write in the back

You can set up public DNS on the router, which will apply to all your devices. It can also be set independently on a computer or mobile phone as needed. The configuration methods of Win, macOS, Linux and other systems can be easily searched.

And not just computers and mobile phones, such as XBox, PS4 and other game consoles or any network equipment, you can basically set DNS. If you are playing games or downloading games too slowly or too stupidly, you might as well try changing a DNS to see the effect.
