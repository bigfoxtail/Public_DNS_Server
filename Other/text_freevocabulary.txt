Domain Name System (DNS) serves as the internet’s phonebook. DNS works particularly in translating familiar domain names such as google.com into an IP address. It is an IP address that is the ideal form for the internet to load the content of the page you want to open.

The configuration of DNS is very complex. This is because the information isn’t stored in a particular database. Instead, information is shared among a worldwide directory which comprises many DNS servers.

Well, the good news is that an average internet user isn’t required to know any or all ofthese technical details. Whenever you type in a URL in your web browser, your ISP must look for the most suitable IP address for the page you want to view. By this, it is your ISP that will automatically give you access to a DNS server when you want to browse.

Wondering Why You Need Different DNS Servers?
Wondering Why You Need Different DNS Servers?
Wondering Why You Need Different DNS Servers?
There are many reasons for this. The first is when there is a problem with the current DNS server you are using. And you can detect DNS serve fault by merely typing the website’s IP address in your browser. Here, when you can access the site through its IP address, but can’t do the same through the name, it then means that the DNS server is faulty.

Second, another reason is when you need an enhanced performing service. This is mostly needed by people who experience sluggish browsing from their ISP.

Third, you may need a different DNS server when you need to avoid the blocking of some websites. Similarly, when you need to prevent the logging of your online activities. Well, but it not every DNS server that will save you from traffic logging. If you need particularly that, read through a DNS provider’s FAQs to ensure that they offer what you want.

However, if you want to use the particular DNS server which your ISP choose tobe the best for you, then you don’t have to set the DNS server address manually. They will automatically assign it.

On a final note, if there is a mixup somewhere, a free DNS server will NOT offer you free access to the internet. If you still need internet access, you need an ISP where you can connect to for internet access. What DNS servers do is translate those IP address numbers into a domain you can easily read and remember.
